# osm-qgis
This is my presentation for [MaptimeTirana](maptime.io/tirana)

It is a simple intro on how to get [OSM](openstreetmap.org) data on your PC and use it with [QGIS](qgis.org).

It is made with [big](https://github.com/tmcw/big/) from [tmcw](https://macwright.org/)

The presentation is in albanian.
